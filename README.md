# CrunchyKiller
C#/ASM PSX Cruncher/Decruncher via Runtime Length Encoding
(Compatible with Silpheed/Hitmen's ASM ByteKiller decrunch routine.)

Note: this is mostly for archival's sake and to have a working source 
in the 64 bit era. as such, its a direct side-by-side translation of
the originals with minimal language-specific features + documentation.

It works very well, but unless you specifically need it to decompress/recompress old PSX/Amiga stuff (Or you kinda fancy using it for nostalgia's sake), it might be worth going with something more modern from https://github.com/PeterLemon or https://github.com/Lameguy64.

Note!
Some Amiga versions would use a different header layout! (E.g. write location and length may be reversed!) Double check before using.
